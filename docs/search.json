In equivalent public health situations today, what other data gathering mechanisms might be available?\nIn these two settings, how did investigators go about formulating a hypothesis for an underlying cause of the disease outbreaks? What did they do to test their hypotheses?\n\n\nAnother conundrum to consider: In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, an article that explored many different risk factors for COVID was circulating. The study authors used data from hospitalized patients to scan for factors associated with having COVID. Surprisingly, smoking was found to be protective for COVID‚Äìthat is, smokers were found to be less likely to have COVID:\n\n\n\nHere is the study that inspired this tweetorial. üëáüèºThey looked at a truly huge number of people presenting to medical care in the UK and then compared how common it was for people to die in hospital from COVID across a whoooooole bunch of different types of people. https://t.co/sw2NcCvglr\n\n‚Äî Dr Ellie Murray, ScD (@EpiEllie) May 8, 2020\n\n\n\nDiscuss the following with your groups, and record your thoughts:\n\nBrainstorm some ideas for the counterintuitive finding that smoking protects against getting COVID.\nThe concept of ‚Äúcorrelation does not imply causation‚Äù is the idea that just because two factors seem to be related doesn‚Äôt mean that one causes the other. How do you think that we can try to determine whether a given correlation (an apparent relationship between two factors) is actually causation (a relationship in which one actually does cause the other)?"

    "text": "Learning goals\nAfter this lesson, you should be able to:\n\nDescribe the difference between prevalence and incidence in terms of the concepts of disease risk and disease burden.\nEvaluate whether information on prevalence or incidence is more relevant to a particular public health question.\nCompute prevalence, cumulative incidence, and incidence rate from appropriate data.\nDescribe how the prevalence of a disease is affected by incidence and typical duration of disease.\n\n\n\n\nReview of video material\nCentral question: how ‚Äúcommon‚Äù is a given disease?\nThinking about the word ‚Äúcommon‚Äù involves contrasting the notions of disease risk and burden.\n\nRisk: How likely is it for an individual to develop this disease within a given time span?\n\nConcerned with new disease cases\nMeasured with incidence (cumulative incidence and incidence rate)\n\nBurden: How much of the population is living with the disease now?\n\nConcerned with existing disease cases\nMeasured with prevalence\n\n\nWith prevalence and incidence measures, we need to be very careful about denominators. Everyone represented by the denominator must be capable of being counted in the numerator‚Äìotherwise, the measure gives a distorted view of how ‚Äúcommon‚Äù the disease is.\n\n\\text{Prevalence} = \\frac{\\text{# cases at a given time}}{\\text{# who COULD be a case at a given time}}\n\nExample: In a recent survey of 1000 people, 11 report having asthma. The estimated prevalence of asthma would be 11/1000 = 0.011 or 1.1%. - Interpretation: An estimated 1.1% of people are living with asthma right now.\nQuestion: Suppose we are trying to estimate the prevalence of COVID at Macalester on January 1, 2024. Do you think that ‚Äútotal # of employees hired and students enrolled on Jan 1‚Äù is a good denominator? Explain.\n\n\\text{Cumulative incidence} = \\frac{\\text{# NEW cases that develop over a time span}}{\\text{# who COULD be a case in that time span}}\n\nExample: A study followed 1000 children fully for the first 5 years of their lives. 12 develop asthma within that time. The estimated cumulative incidence would be 12/1000 = 0.012 or 1.2%. - Interpretation: We estimate that 1.2% of children will develop asthma in the first 5 years of life.\n\n\\text{Incidence rate} = \\frac{\\text{# NEW cases that develop over a time span}}{\\text{Total person-years at risk}}\n\n\nIf individuals in a study are followed up for different lengths of time, it is better to use the incidence rate rather than cumulative incidence so that the total time that individuals were followed up is more accurately represented.\n\nWhy? A study follows 1000 people for 5 years, but most individuals stop participating in the study by year 2. We‚Äôre really not observing the 1000 people for the full 5 years. There‚Äôs quite a lot of time in those 5 years that we‚Äôre not observing people who may develop disease. Using cumulative incidence would understate the risk of the disease.\n\n\nExample: A study followed 1000 children for the first 5 years of their lives for a total of 2500 person-years of follow up. 12 develop asthma within that time. The estimated incidence rate would be 12/2500 = 0.0048 cases per person-year. - Interpretation: We estimate that 0.0048 new cases of asthma in children per person-year. Because 1/0.0048 = 208.33, we could also phrase this as 1 case per 208.33 person-years.\n\nFor conditions that are not very common (low prevalence):\n\n\\text{Prevalence} \\approx \\text{Incidence} \\times \\text{Mean disease duration}\n\nWhy is this approximate relationship important? - A disease that is common (high prevalence) doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the risk of getting that disease is high. It might just be that - Example: Males have a higher melanoma incidence, but males survive a shorter amount of time (see here and here) with it than females. Females might have a higher prevalence of melanoma than males even though their risk is lower.\n\n\n\nActivity\nNavigate to Moodle, and open the PDF titled 02_measuring_disease_activity."

    "text": "Community is key\nA sense of community and connectedness can provide a powerful environment for learning: Research shows that learning is maximized when students feel a sense of belonging in the educational environment (e.g., Booker, 2016). A negative climate may create barriers to learning, while a positive climate can energize students‚Äô learning (e.g., Pascarella & Terenzini, cited in How Learning Works, 2012).\nFor these reasons, I will be designing our in-class group activities to intentionally foster commmunity and connectedness. You can help cultivate our classroom community by being thoughtful about the way you engage with others in class."

    "section": "My philosophy",
    "text": "My philosophy\nGrading is thorny issue for many educators because of its known negative effects on learning and motivation. Nonetheless, it is ever-present in the US education system and at Macalester. Because I am required to submit grades for this course, it‚Äôs worth me taking a minute to share my philosophy about grading with you.\nWhat excites me about being a teacher is your learning. Learning flourishes in an environment where you find meaning and value in what we‚Äôre exploring, feel safe engaging with challenging things, receive useful feedback, and regularly reflect on your learning.\nIf I didn‚Äôt have to give grades, I wouldn‚Äôt. But because I am required to, it is important to me to create a course structure and grading system that creates an environment for learning to flourish:\n\nFinding meaning and value: I am striving to achieve this by creating space for authentic connection between you, your peers, and myself and by encouraging you to explore a topic that intrigues you for our course project.\nSafety in engaging with challenges: The assignments and activities that we will use to learn are meant to be challenging, and it would be unreasonable for me to expect that you perform perfectly on the first try. For this reason, every assignment and assessment has an opportunity for unlimited revisions/reattempts without penalty. I hope that this alleviates stress considerably. If ever you are feeling overwhelmed by this course, please reach out to me. We‚Äôll find a way to make things more manageable.\n\nNote: While the number of revisions you can submit is unlimited in theory, in practice, there is a limit to how quickly the preceptors and I can review revisions and give feedback.\n\nReceiving useful feedback and reflecting regularly: In order to learn maximally by pursuing a revision, you need BOTH good feedback and to reflect thoughtfully about misconceptions in your learning. Our preceptors and I will strive to give useful comments and prompts to spur reflection when we see room for improvement. A requirement for submitting a revision is to include a paragraph where you describe and reflect on your prior misconceptions."

(One assignment will be due on a Friday.) Homework will receive a grade of Pass (P) if all responses are mostly correct (only minor errors). Otherwise the grade will be Not Yet (NY).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of homework is to re-engage with core ideas from class in the context of new examples.\n\n\nRevising and resubmitting HW: If you receive a grade of NY, you can revise and resubmit your work without penalty as long as you do the following:\n\nWrite a reflection paragraph at the top of your assignment in which you address: What improvements were you asked to make based on feedback on your previous submission? How has reviewing your feedback improved your understanding? (What do you understand better/differently than you did before?)\nKeep all of your original work intact and include revisions in different color text (e.g., blue or orange)\nSubmit your revised work to the same homework link on Moodle. Email the instructor and preceptors once this is submitted. (We don‚Äôt get email notifications when things are submitted to Moodle.)\n\n\n\nGroup mini-projects\nThere will be 3 mini-projects that will be worked on fully in class the last day of our first 3 units (on Thursdays‚Äîsee our course calendar). If you miss class this day, you will need to complete the mini-project on your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the mini-projects is to synthesize ideas across the topics in a unit and enhance your understanding through collaboration. The projects will be designed to be finished within class time.\n\n\nProjects will a grade of Pass (P) or Not Yet (NY). Requirements for passing each mini-project will be clearly stated on each project prompt.\nRevising and resubmitting mini-projects: If you receive a grade of NY, you can revise and resubmit your work without penalty as long as you do the following:\n\nEach group member must submit a reflection paragraph that addresses: What improvements were you asked to make based on feedback on your previous submission? How has reviewing your feedback improved your understanding? (What do you understand better/differently than you did before?) Each group member should email this reflection paragraph to the instructor.\nOne group member should submit the revised project file to the same link on Moodle. This group member should email the instructor once this is submitted.\n\n\n\nContent conversations\nA content conversation (CC) is a 15 or 20 minute conversation that you and I will have about course content. There will be 2 CC‚Äôs in the semester (weeks of 2/19 and 4/22).\n\nContent conversation 1: This conversation will be 15 minutes. Schedule this during the week of 2/21-2/28 via Calendly.\nContent conversation 2: This conversation will be 20 minutes. Schedule this during the week of 4/22-4/26 via Calendly.\n\nOne week before the CC, I will provide a set of problems that you can (and should!) work on with peers. During the CC, we will talk through a subset of those problems. I will choose some problems that I‚Äôd like you to talk through, and in the time remaining, you will talk through a problem (or part of a problem) of your choosing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of a CC is to encourage deep and collaborative study and to give us both a detailed understanding of your learning.\n\n\nBefore the CC I will provide a rubric that explains how I will assess your understanding. I will also provide requirements for a grade of Pass. If you do not Pass a CC, you will receive a grade of Not Yet.\nRe-attempting a content conversation: If you receive a grade of NY, you can re-attempt the CC without penalty as long as you do the following:\n\nSchedule another conversation of the same length as the original CC (via Calendly).\nRevise how you will talk through the problem (or parts of problems) that you struggled with.\nReflect on the following: What improvements were you asked to make based on feedback on your previous submission? How has reviewing your feedback improved your understanding? (What do you understand better/differently than you did before?) Be prepared to tell me about this reflection at the next CC.\n\n\n\nProject\nWe will have a course-long project in which you apply concepts from class to evaluate research related to a health-adjacent topic of your choosing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the project is to connect course concepts with a topic that is relevant and meaningful to you.\n\n\nOn each homework assignment, there will be a task that advances your project in a way that connects to the most recent course concepts. You will receive feedback that you should incorporate into your final product.\nMore details about the project will be hosted on the Project page."

If it gives you a number, fact, or code, assume it is wrong unless you either know the answer or can check in with another source. AI works best for topics you already understand to a sufficient extent.\nIf you provide minimum effort prompts, you will get low quality results.

Don‚Äôt use it if it isn‚Äôt appropriate for the case or circumstance.\nThe environmental impact of AI should not be ignored. The building and usage of AI tools consumes a lot of energy (see here and here). For this reason, we will be very thoughtful about when we use AI and will discuss other sustainability behaviors that we can incorporate into our lives to offset this usage.\nAI is a tool, but one that you need to acknowledge using. Any ideas, language, or code that is produced by AI must be cited, just like any other resource.\n\nHow to cite AI: Please include a paragraph at the end of any assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get the results.
