# Learning goals

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain the rationale for how cohort studies help us study the link between exposures and disease outcomes.
- Describe the difference between measuring the strength of association between exposure and disease versus impact of exposure on disease risk.
- Compute and interpret a relative risk from study data.
- Compute and interpret an attributable risk (AR) and a population attributable risk (PAR) from study data.

# Recap of video material

## Observational vs. experimental

Observational studies

- Cohort studies (this week)
- Case-control studies (next week)
- Ecological studies (this week)

Experimental studies

- Randomized experiments (after Spring Break)

## Ecological studies

Ecological studies, like cohort studies, are a type of observational study. In these studies, the unit of observation is an **aggregate** (e.g., state, country) rather than an individual person.

The following Ô¨Ågure from [this article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3292773/) shows an example of an ecological study. The unit of observation is a country, and on each country, we have data on breast cancer incidence and average dietary fat consumption.

- What we do learn from this study: There seems to be a relationship between breast cancer incidence and average fat consumption **at the country level**.
- What we do not learn: We do not learn whether there is a relationship between breast cancer incidence and average fat consumption **at the individual level**. That is, we do not learn that an individual is more likely to develop breast cancer if they eat more fat.

The **ecological fallacy** is a term that describes the idea that a conclusion on aggregate data does not necessarily transfer to individuals.

Let's look at one more example. A [New England Journal of Medicine study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmon1211064) looked at the relationship between chocolate consumption and cognitive function by using country-level data:

We'll think more on this study in our exercises.


## Cohort studies

### Study design

Unlike ecological studies, cohort studies obtain data on **individuals**.

- Contextual knowledge leads investigators to explore a particular exposure. Even though *exposure* has the connotation of a harmful exposure, the exposure studied could be a beneficial exposure, like a treatment.
- Once we have identified individuals who were exposed and unexposed, we follow them over time to collect incidence data.
    - This can be done prospectively (actually following forward in time) or retrospectively (looking back historically at an earlier time point and following time forward to the present).

### Using data to make comparisons

Cohort study data allows us to compare incidence between the exposed ($I_{exp}$) and unexposed ($I_{unexp}$).

**Ratios:**

- **Relative risk:** $I_{exp}/I_{unexp}$
    - It measures how strongly associated exposure and disease are.
    - *Interpretation:* If RR = 2, we say that the exposed group is 2 times as likely to experience the outcome as the unexposed group.

**Differences:**

- **Attributable risk in the exposed (AR):** $I_{exp} - I_{unexp}$
    - This measures impact of exposure (or excess risk) in exposed individuals. If we could have removed the exposure for people who were exposed, how much disease could we prevent?
    - *Interpretation:* If AR = 130 cases/100,000 people, we interpret this AR as "If there were 100,000 fewer exposures, we would expect to see 130 fewer disease cases."

- **Attributable risk in the population (PAR):** $I_{pop} - I_{unexp}$
    - This measures the impact of exposure in a population. If we could remove an exposure for an entire population, how much disease could we prevent?
    - *Interpretation:* If PAR = 90 cases/100,000 people, we interpret this AR as "If we eliminated the exposure across the entire population, we would expect to see 90 fewer disease cases per 100,000 people."
    - Note: PAR will be between 0 and AR.
        - The extreme of 0 represents the impact if *no one* in the population is exposed.
        - The extreme of AR represents the impact if *everyone* in the population is exposed.
        - We can also see that PAR is between 0 and AR from the fact that $PAR = AR \times \text{Prevalence of exposure}$ because exposure prevalence is between 0 and 1.
