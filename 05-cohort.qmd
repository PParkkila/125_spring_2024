# Learning goals

After this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain the rationale for how cohort studies help us study the link between exposures and disease outcomes.
- Describe the difference between measuring the strength of association between exposure and disease versus impact of exposure on disease risk.
- Compute and interpret a relative risk from study data.
- Compute and interpret an attributable risk (AR) and a population attributable risk (PAR) from study data.

# Recap of video material

## Observational vs. experimental

## Ecological studies

Ecological studies, like cohort studies, are a type of observational study. In these studies, the unit of observation is an **aggregate** (e.g., state, country) rather than an individual person.

The following Ô¨Ågure from [this article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3292773/) shows an example of an ecological study. The unit of observation is a country, and on each country, we have data on breast cancer incidence and average dietary fat consumption.

- What we do learn from this study: There seems to be a relationship between breast cancer incidence and average fat consumption **at the country level**.
- What we do not learn: We do not learn whether there is a relationship between breast cancer incidence and average fat consumption **at the individual level**. That is, we do not learn that an individual is more likely to develop breast cancer if they eat more fat.

The **ecological fallacy** is a term that describes the idea that a conclusion on aggregate data does not necessarily transfer to individuals.

Let's look at one more example. A [New England Journal of Medicine study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmon1211064) looked at the relationship between chocolate consumption and cognitive function by using country-level data:

We'll think more on this study in our exercises.


## Cohort studies

Unlike ecological studies, cohort studies obtain data on **individuals**.

- Contextual knowledge leads investigators to explore a particular exposure. Even though *exposure* has the connotation of a harmful exposure, the exposure studied could be a beneficial exposure, like a treatment.
- Once we have identified individuals who were exposed and unexposed, we follow them over time to collect incidence data.
    - This can be done prospectively (actually following forward in time) or retrospectively (looking back historically at an earlier time point and following time forward to the present).

Comparing incidence between the exposed ($I_{exp}$) and unexposed ($I_{unexp}$)

- Ratios: $I_{exp}/I_{unexp}$ - this is a **relative risk (RR) ** and measures how strongly associated exposure and disease are.
    - Interpretation: We say that one group is RR times as likely to experience the outcome relative to another group.
- Differences:
    - **Attributable risk in the exposed (AR):** $I_{exp} - I_{unexp}$
        - This measures impact of exposure (or excess risk) in exposed individuals.
        - Interpretation: If AR = 130 cases/100,000 people, we interpret this AR as "If there were 100,000 fewer exposures, we would expect to see 130 fewer disease cases."
    - **Attributable risk in the population (PAR):** $I_{pop} - I_{unexp}$
        - This measures the impact of exposure in a population.
        - Interpretation: If PAR = 90 cases/100,000 people, we interpret this AR as "If there were 100,000 fewer exposures in the population, we would expect to see 90 fewer disease cases."
